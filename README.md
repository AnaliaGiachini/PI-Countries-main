Henry Solo Project Countries

"I created a web application that focuses on countries from around the world. This application enables users to search for countries by their names. Upon selecting a specific country, the application displays essential information, including the country's name, flag, capital city, continent, and other relevant details.

Moreover, users can create tourist activities associated with each country. The application also features sorting and filtering options based on various criteria, such as alphabetical order (both ascending and descending), population size, continents, and types of tourist activities."
